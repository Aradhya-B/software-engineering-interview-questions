## Description
A Singly Linked List is a list of nodes that are connected with unidirectional pointers. The entire structure will keep track of the head of the list, while each node in the list will hold data of any type and a pointer to the next node.
The tail of the list will be the first node that does not hold a pointer to a next node.

## When do I use a linked list over Arrays?
1. If you need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list.
2. If you aren't sure how many items will be in the list.
3. When you don't require random access to any elements.
4. You want to be able to easily insert elements in the middle of the list.
